# chicken-invaders
Chicken Invaders game, made a year ago, now decided to commit it onto github

An assignment project in IP (Intro to Programming), written in Processing (a Java IDE). Inspired by the same game, but with some of our own ideas here and there, esp the ship selection

This is supposed to be a group project but most of the designing, coding and testing is done by me, groupmates mostly helped out with graphics and some final testing of the game. Final score: 91/100, highest among the class
